This asset (Cloak & Hood) contains 4 layers (though more may be added in the future), each designated with a 4-digit abbreviation:

mnpl ("mantle, plain")
lnpl ("long cloak, plain")
hdpl ("hood, plain")
hddn ("hood, down")

You are free to use these any way you wish, but they are intended to act as 2 paper doll layers on my Character Base.
The cloak layer (2clo) may be comprised of the mantle, the cloak, or the mantle ON TOP of the cloak (not the other way around).

  Side note: You can stack the mantle on the cloak in-engine, or using image-editing software, like Aseprite or Photoshop.

The hat layer (5hat) may be comprised of the hood up, or the hood down, not both.
Furthermore, you should not use either of the hoods without either the mantle or the cloak (or both) beneath it, it won't look right.

Hope that clears up any possible confusion. Enjoy!
